My project is essentially a history flashcard that allows people to take studying and turn it into fun
For some people it can be to test their intellectual skills
I have used android studio in assissting me in making the app
It contains various questions with all feedbacks being given out
There is no target group as any ages will be able to participate and experience
I have used GitHub to commit and push my final project which allowed me to track any changes to compare
It is a simplee app to use and can easily be navigated through
